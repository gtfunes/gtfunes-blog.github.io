---

Getting set up on a Windows/Linux/macOS system from scratch is not something that happens everyday, but when it does, it's always a pain remembering everything you had installed and configured. Everyone has their favorite or most useful applications they install first thing when you get a new system. This post is focused on the macOS version of my must have apps.

### Security

* [1Password](https://1password.com/): A password manager is a must this days to use strong passwords (if you can use SSO instead of setting a password, always use SSO).
* [Authy](https://authy.com/): Manage your Two-Factor authentication codes using this online service with apps for every OS.
* [Suspicious Package](https://mothersruin.com/software/SuspiciousPackage/): Preview plugin to check installer packages' signature, download origin and more for increased security before installing anything.

### Usability

* [AltTab](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/): I never liked the macOS version of `alt-tab` to change between application windows, this app changes it to a more Windows style that works a lot better in my opinion.
* [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704): Very helpful app to stop your Mac from going into sleep mode even when the lid is closed.
* [Bartender 3](https://www.macbartender.com/): Lets you organize you menu bar icons and hide them to avoid having too many icons.
* [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/): Fully configure your Mac's keyboard (third-party or otherwise), change any key to any action you want and modify function keys actions. 
* [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/): Move and resize windows any way you want, make them fullscreen or make them take any part of the screen you want.
