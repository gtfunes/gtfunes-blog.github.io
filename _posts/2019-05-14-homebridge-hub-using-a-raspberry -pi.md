title:  "Homebridge hub using a Raspberry Pi"
---

I found out about Homebridge a few months ago and I was immediatly intrigued. Being able to integrate almost any device with Apple‚Äôs HomeKit sounded amazing.

I started testing it out on Windows 10 and it was quite easy to setup and use. Once I tested it for a few days I thought it was time to step it up and run in on my Pi.

My setup used the following plugins:

*   [homebridge-samsung-tizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-samsung-tizen): Lets you control your Samsung TVs
*   [homebridge-plex-v2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-plex-v2): Manages your Plex players (you can also [adjust your Hue lights](https://www.howtogeek.com/305277/how-to-set-your-hue-lights-to-movie-mode-when-watching-plex-media-center/) while using Plex)
*   [homebridge-people](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-people): Monitors who is at home, based on their smartphone being seen on the network recently
*   [homebridge-automation-chromecast](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-automation-chromecast): Creates a switch linked with the status of a Chromecast or Chromecast Audio device
*   [homebridge-camera-ffmpeg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg): Lets you link your home cameras
*   [homebridge-hue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-hue): Exposes ZigBee devices (lights, plugs, sensors, switches, etc) connected to a Philips [Hue](http://www2.meethue.com/) bridge or a dresden elektronik [deCONZ](https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin) gateway
*   [homebridge-winpc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-winpc): Remotely wake or turn off Windows PCs

After searching for the best ways to set Homebridge up automatically on Linux I stumbled upon [this great GitHub repo](https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge). A Docker image running on Alpine Linux with Homebridge and Homebridge UI ready to go.

I adapted the startup script of the Docker image to install this plugins automatically but I found out that some of them required other components being installed on the host. This was necessary for [homebridge-people](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-people) and [homebridge-camera-ffmpeg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg), they required the `iputils` and the `ffmpeg` packages respectibly so I added them to be installed on the startup script as well.

After that I, [forked the original repo](https://github.com/gtfunes/docker-homebridge) to add my changes so it would be easier to have everything setup, and I decided to make this guide so anyone could have their own Homebridge hub with some basic plugins. This guide is a combination of the [wiki of the original repo](https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge/wiki) with a few additions and clarifications that I found useful.

Requirements
============

*   A Raspberry Pi 1 Model B or later
*   An SD Card

Initial setup
=============

*   Get the latest copy of Raspbian Stretch Lite from the [official website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
*   [Install the system image on your SD Card](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md)

Raspbian headless boot
======================

You can enable SSH and Wi-Fi (optional) services before we boot from the SD card for the first time. Once you burn the OS image to your SD card, access it from your computer. You should see it under the name ‚Äúboot‚Äù. Create two files on the root of the SD card:

*   The first file should have the name _‚Äússh‚Äù_ and no content (just an empty file)
*   The second file (optional) should be named _‚Äúwpa\_supplicant.conf‚Äù_ and contain the following:

```
country=YOUR\_COUNTRY\_CODE  
ctrl\_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa\_supplicant GROUP=netdev  
update\_config=1  
  
network={  
    ssid="YOUR\_SSID"  
    scan\_ssid=1  
    psk="YOUR\_PASSWORD"  
    key\_mgmt=WPA-PSK  
}
```

Replace _‚ÄúYOUR\_COUNTRY\_CODE‚Äù_ with your two-letter [country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code).

Login
=====

You can now boot your Raspberry Pi and connect using SSH.

You should be able to connect using `raspberrypi.local` as the hostname. If not then you'll need to find out what IP address the Raspberry Pi was assigned and connect using that instead. If you need help finding your Pi‚Äôs IP address you can use [this great tool](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Pi-Finder) made by Adafruit, it runs on Windows, Mac or Linux.

```
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
```

The default username is `pi` and the password is`raspberry`. You should change the default password now using the `passwd` command.

Installation
============

Run the quick install script:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gtfunes/docker-homebridge/master/raspbian-installer.sh -o get-homebridge.sh  
chmod u+x get-homebridge.sh  
./get-homebridge.sh
```

After installing everything, Docker will start Homebridge automatically and it will also run on boot.

Managing Homebridge
===================

To manage Homebridge go to `http://raspberrypi.local:8080` (or the IP address of your Pi) in your browser. From here you can manage your plugins, edit the main `config.json` file, view log files and restart the service.

<img class="s t u ii ai" src="/assets/images/2019-05-14-homebridge-hub-using-a-raspberry-pi/1.png" role="presentation"/>

The default username for the management console is `admin` and the password is`admin`. You can change the default password later from the _‚ÄúUser Accounts‚Äù_ menu.

Connecting with HomeKit
=======================

You should now be able to see your newly created`Homebridge` as a HomeKit accessory in the Home app on your iOS device. Tap on the _‚Äú+‚Äù_ button on the top right corner and select _‚ÄúAdd Accessory‚Äù_. You can pair the device using the QR code displayed in Homebridge UI or by selecting the _‚ÄúDon‚Äôt have a Code or Can‚Äôt Scan‚Äù_ option and using the default pairing pin: `031-45-154` (shown under the QR code).

Or you can just scan the QR code with the camera app on your iOS device and it will take you straight to the Home app. It just works‚Ñ¢.

Once this is done you will see all your configured accessories inside the Home app.

Docker administration from the browser
======================================

One of the great features of Homebridge UI is the ability to view Homebridge‚Äôs logs live, restarting the Docker container and editing the startup script from your browser.

<img class="s t u ii ai" src="/assets/images/2019-05-14-homebridge-hub-using-a-raspberry-pi/3.png" role="presentation"/>

Tapping on the Docker icon on the top right corner of the screen shows more options:

<img class="s t u ii ai" src="/assets/images/2019-05-14-homebridge-hub-using-a-raspberry-pi/4.png" role="presentation"/>

Homebridge UI offers everything you need to manage your Docker container without leaving your browser, this makes it really easy to edit any configurations. Just remember to restart the container after any changes.

Configuration
=============

From the _‚ÄúConfig‚Äù_ menu you can edit the `config.json` file directly to add or edit your Homebridge devices. You can check the links for every plugin‚Äôs NPM repository page on how to configure each of them.

Shell access
============

If you require direct shell access to the container without using Homebridge UI, you can do so by running the following command inside the _‚Äúhomebridge‚Äù_ folder:

```
docker-compose exec homebridge sh
```

Manual restart
==============

You can restart the container from the command line at any time by running the following command inside the _‚Äúhomebridge‚Äù_ folder:

```
docker-compose restart homebridge
```

That‚Äôs it!
==========

You now have a Homebridge hub running on your Pi that‚Äôs easy to manage and update.

You can check other useful plugins [here](https://github.com/sahilchaddha/awesome-homebridge) and there‚Äôs also an [IFTTT integration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-notification).

The great thing about running this inside a Docker container is that you could run it anywhere, on any OS and it will work the same way.

I love doing little projects like this one using a Raspberry Pi and I hope you enjoy your new smart home!
